In all of this “cyber noise,” how can these organizations understand their risks and how to mitigate them? The answer is an Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) like you who will break down complex threats into manageable plans of action. 

As an ISSO on our team, you will use your experience to work with government stakeholders and a cloud-based application and platform development team to identify cyber risks, understand applicable policies, and develop a mitigation plan. You’ll review technical, environmental, and personnel details from security engineers, platform and application developers, and enterprise architects to assess the entire threat landscape. You will coordinate with product delivery teams to ensure their products meet DoD cybersecurity standards and support a larger cyber team to collectively guide your client through a plan of action with presentations, documentation, and milestones.

You will work with your client to translate security concepts, so they can make the best decisions to secure cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, containerized applications, CI/CD application pipelines, and sensitive data repositories. You will conduct risk assessments, considering data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. You will be involved in organized Incident Response actions, such as guiding and reporting back to key stakeholders. You will support the team in meeting authorization timelines and coordinating communications with external entities in support of that objective.

This is your opportunity to act as an information security subject matter expert while broadening your skills in AWS, AI or ML, containerization, CI/CD, Agile development, DevSecOps, risk management, and data security. Work with us as we protect the DoD's critical analytic capabilities.
